# Shrek 2.2
A major full-game mod designed to majorly improve the overall experience, as well as finishing a lot of things the developers likely would've done.
This mod is majorly in alpha and is not considered to be anywhere close to finished.


# To play yourself:
- Download the entire project, then make a new game directory and use this project as the directory
- Unzip AllDialog.zip in ...\Sounds
- Delete your Shrek 2 documents folder (...\Documents\Shrek 2)
