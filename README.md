# Shrek 2.2
A major full-game mod designed to majorly improve the overall experience, as well as finishing a lot of things the developers likely would've done.
This mod is majorly in alpha and is not considered to be anywhere close to finished. Support past the modified levels should not be expected, as the game will not play as intended.


# To play yourself:
- Download the entire project, then make a new game directory and use this project as the directory
- Unzip AllDialog.zip in ...\Sounds
- Run game.exe in ...\System
- Have fun :) -- If you run into any issues, report it as an issue on the issues board


# How to help contribute to the project
If you think you're capable of creating content for Shrek 2.2, whether it be maps, graphics, sounds, scripts or animations, you are needed! You can get started by download GitHub Desktop, then cloning this repository with the software. From this point, you need to patch your level editor with the 2.2 files (every time a build is pushed just to be safe), which you can do by locating modified files in the 2.2 directory, such as the modified files in the following folders: Animations, Sounds, StaticMeshes, System (only for SH22.u and MPak.u) and Textures. Once you do that and make your changes, propose an issue to become a contributor, then once you are added as a contributor (if you become verified), you can make a commit to the repository, which can then be reviewed by other modders. If you are unsure how to help but want to help, please contact Master_64 in the Shrekciety Discord: https://discord.com/invite/0VEIly8qa8WUZAzV

If you do not want to modify game files but you still want to provide suggestions for how Shrek 2.2 could be improved, please fill out feature suggestions or bug reports seen on the issue board!

# The ultimate goal
In the end, I wish for this project to be the ultimate Shrek 2 (PC) experience everyone has always wanted. Something more full of life, with more creativity, more features and replayability, all while keeping the original concept of the game intact. I do not want to modify parts of the game so much to the point it loses its identity (such as drastically changing the style of the game, or changing the entire gameplay flow), because for me, that would defeat the purpose of the mod. While I understand that Shrek 2.2 will likely not feel like the same game, I'm hoping to make it more fun and enjoyable for the long-term over the original Shrek 2 (PC) game, even going as far as making modding potentially easier for Shrek 2.2 (although no promises).

# How is this project in alpha after 5 years?
Lots of modding discoveries have been constantly happening since this time, and a lot of time was put into side-projects that weren't related to Shrek 2.2, aside from the Master Pack library mod, which has been in development for over 2 years, which will make Shrek 2.2 possible to program. Had it not taken this long to get where we are now, Shrek 2.2 would not have the potential to be as good as it will be in the future. You will just have to trust in the fact this project has been constantly been in development for over 5 years, despite a majority of that time not being put directly into Shrek 2.2, rather the time was put into making better modding tools to make this sort of project possible.
