# Shrek 2.2
A major full-game mod designed to majorly improve the overall experience, as well as finishing a lot of things the developers likely would've done.
This mod is majorly in alpha and is not considered to be anywhere close to finished.

# The ultimate goal
In the end, I wish for this project to be the Shrek 2 (PC) experience I've always wanted. Something more full of life, with more creativity, more features and replayability, all while keeping the original concept of the game intact. I do not want to modify parts of the game so much to the point it loses its identity (such as drastically changing the style of the game, or changing the entire gameplay flow), because for me, that would defeat the purpose of the mod. While I understand that Shrek 2.2 will likely not feel like the same game, I'm hoping to make it more fun and enjoyable for the long-term over the original Shrek 2 (PC) game, even going as far as making modding potentially easier for Shrek 2.2 (although no promises).

# How is this project in alpha after 5 years?
Lots of modding discoveries have been constantly happening since this time, and a lot of time was put into side-projects that weren't related to Shrek 2.2, aside from the Master Pack library mod, which has been in development for over 2 years, which will make Shrek 2.2 possible to program. Had it not taken this long to get where we are now, Shrek 2.2 would not have the potential to be as good as it will be in the future. You will just have to trust in the fact this project has been constantly been in development for over 5 years, despite a majority of that time not being put directly into Shrek 2.2, rather the time was put into making better modding tools to make this sort of project possible.
