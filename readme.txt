INTRODUCTION

Shrek 2.2 is an open-source community-driven project that overhauls the original experience, while keeping the original style you love! The repository can be reviewed from here: https://github.com/Master-64/Shrek-2.2

If you have any questions about the project, or have any issues with the game, it is advised to directly contact the Shrek 2.2 development team directly, instead of Activision Customer Support. This game is over 20 years old, so don't expect their customer support team to understand this game.


Refer to this document if you encounter difficulties with one or more aspects of installation or running the Shrek 2.2 game. Many of the most commonly encountered issues are covered here.

Shrek 2.2 is an open-source community-driven project that overhauls the original experience, while keeping the original style you love! The repository can be reviewed from here: https://github.com/Master-64/Shrek-2.2


INSTALLATION & SETUP

1.	Minimum System Requirements

- 3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectX® 10-compliant 256 megabytes graphics card and drivers (or 9.0b-compliant 16 megabytes if running in-game compatibility mode)*
- A Microsoft® Windows® operating system starting from Vista or newer
- Pentium® III 450 MHz or Athlon® 600 MHz or faster processor
- 128 megabytes of RAM
- 620 megabytes of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 200 megabytes for the Windows® swap file and 60 megabytes free for saved games)

*Supported Chipsets for Windows® Vista
All nVidia GeForce™ chipsets
nVidia TnT™ and TnT2™
All ATI Radeon™ chipsets
Matrox Parhelia™

*Important Note:	Some graphics cards with the chipsets listed here may not be compatible with the 3D acceleration features utilized by Shrek 2.2. Please refer to your hardware manufacturer for 100% DirectX® 10 (or 9.0b) compatibility.


2.	Game Patching

The Shrek 2.2 game cannot be instantly played once downloaded, without running into issues. Once you've installed the game directory, you need to open the folder "Sounds" located in the game's directory, then you should find a file named "AllDialog.7z.001". Right-click on it and click "Extract Here".*

After doing this, the game is safe to be ran. Simply run the file "game.exe" located in the game directory folder named "System".

*If you're missing this option, you must install 7-Zip from here: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html


VIDEO ISSUES

1.	Monitors

- Please make sure your monitor supports the game resolution you are trying to play in. To check what resolutions your monitor supports, do the following:
a) Open up My Computer
b) Double-click on Control Panel
c) Find the Display icon and open it.
d) Choose the Settings tab.
e) Locate the resolution pointer in the Desktop Area box and drag it to the far right.

The resolution choice shown is the maximum resolution your monitor is capable of displaying. If you do not want to change to this resolution now, select cancel. Your Desktop Area should be set to the game resolution you are trying to play in or higher.

NOTE:	Please make sure your monitor type is properly specified to ensure correct reporting of available video resolutions.


2.	Overall Low Performance

If your hardware graphics card doesn't not support DirectX 10, the game will run at a very low performance. If this happens, launch the game, go into the main menu, then go into the video options and enable Compatibility Mode. Once applied, restart the game and the performance issue should be resolved.


3.	In-game and Desktop resolutions

Do not choose an in-game resolution that is higher than your desktop resolution. You may only be able to see as much of the game as is viewable at your desktop resolution. (For example, if your desktop resolution is set to 1280x720, and you choose an in-game resolution of 1920x1080, the game screen may stretch beyond the size of your monitor screen).	This issue will be more prevalent in windowed mode.


4.	Setting Object Detail

When changing the Object Detail setting from Low to Medium or High, the changes will not be reflected in the current level. In order for this feature to perform the necessary optimizations for low end systems, the objects are deleted from the save file and cannot be re-created in that level. When switching from Low to Medium or High Object Detail, those changes will be reflected in the next level that is loaded.


5.	Temporary Graphical Corruption when Changing Video Settings

Changing the settings on your Video Options page may sometimes result in temporary color corruption of the page. These irregularities will disappear when you return to the game.


6.	NVIDIA® TNT2 Vanta™ Texture Corruption

Users playing Shrek 2.2 on a NVIDIA® TNT2 Vanta™ may see some graphical corruptions and flickering textures. These errors are specific to the TNT2 Vanta™ graphics card.


7.	ATI® Radeon™ 9000 Water Texture Corruption

Users playing Shrek 2.2 on an ATI® Radeon™ 9000 graphics card may see some texture flickering. These errors are specific to the Radeon™ 9000 card.


8.	Advanced Video Settings

Certain graphical settings can be adjusted to improve the visual fidelity of Shrek 2.2. Advanced video settings require a game restart upon changing any setting related to the advanced video settings tab. Do not be alarmed when the game closes automatically if you've modified an advanced video setting, this is intended behavior.



WINDOWS® SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEM ISSUES


1.	Alt-Tab or Alt-Enter

Provided Shrek 2.2 is not running on compatibility mode, Shrek 2.2 fully supports using Alt-Tab or Alt-Enter without any issues. If using compatibility mode, Alt-Enter will work fine if Shrek 2.2 started in Windowed mode (which it does by default), however Alt-Tab is not recommended to use in this case as it may cause the game to crash.


2. Windows® XP and Older Compatibility

The Windows® XP operating system and before are NOT officially supported by Shrek 2.2, but should be doable to get working if you are a technical user. Any operating systems starting from Windows® Vista and onward should always remain officially supported. Shrek 2.2 especially does not run on Microsoft® Windows® 95 or NT, however this is also the case with the original Shrek 2 game.


3.	Save Game Space

Please make sure you have at least 60 megabytes of disk space on the storage drive that Shrek 2.2 has been installed to.


MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES


1.	 Movie Skipping

You can skip movies in the game with the Escape key. At any point during a movie, hit the Escape key and the current movie will end immediately.
